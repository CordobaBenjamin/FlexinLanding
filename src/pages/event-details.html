					<h4>Description</h4>
					<p>
						Every business lives and breathes competition. It's a fundamental
						part of the world we live in and dominates leadership priorities.
						“How can we provide a better product, a more engaging experience,
						or offer clearer value than our competitors?” These are the
						questions that keep many of us up at night.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-0">
						Introducing 2 key roles into your sales strategy can make a
						significant difference: business development representatives
						(BDRs) and sales development representatives (SDRs). These roles
						are designed to focus on specific stages of the buyer's journey,
						ensuring that your sales reps are free to concentrate on what they
						do best. BDRs specialise in identifying new business
						opportunities, while SDRs are adept at nurturing these leads,
						setting the stage for successful appointments.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section-space-md-bottom">
					<h4>Challenge</h4>
					<p class="mb-0">
						The client needed to boost their lead-to-appointment conversions.
						Despite having a strong online presence and over 20 marketing
						channels at their disposal, they needed to streamline their
						campaign management and weed through vast volumes of leads. Their
						global business development and subject-matter expert team needed
						a steady flow of high-quality meetings tailored to various
						regions.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section-space-md-bottom">
					<h4>Solutions</h4>
					<p>
						BDRs, like any sales representative, are focused on acquiring new
						customers. However, this specific type of sales rep generally
						focuses exclusively on outbound lead generation. They'll likely
						make cold calls and send emails and direct messages to foster
						relationships with new prospects.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-0">
						Because BDRs interact with prospects unfamiliar with the
						organisation, BDRs move slowly and strategically to keep their
						leads interested. BDRs collaborate with sales teams to create an
						effective outbound strategy that nurtures leads down the
						appointment-setting funnel.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section-space-md-bottom">
					<h4>Diverse and tailored email campaigns</h4>
					<p>
						As highlighted above, SDRs have a different role at Belkins than
						is often the case. Rather than just managing inbound prospects,
						SDRs manage lead generation and appointment-setting for all our
						clients. They're a critical part of our client delivery team.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-0">
						SDRs for Belkins are in charge of email outreach and
						appointment-setting, but they also support account managers with
						project management and client communication. They're integral to
						client-focused projects, driving action and facilitating team
						communication.

				<h4>Event Map</h4>

					speakers including game changing not just a large-scale conference,
